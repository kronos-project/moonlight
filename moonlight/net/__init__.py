"""
Data structures and interpreters used in the transmission of Wizard101
and W101 tooling applications. Includes parsers for DML, control data,
objectproperty, netpack flagtool, and extensions of the scapy API for
working with wireshark captures of that data. In particular, see
`PacketReader` and `moonlight.net.scapy.PcapReader`.

For classes requiring the `scapy` library, please look under
`moonlight.net.scapy` and lazy-load when possible. Scapy network scans at
the time of package import and there is no way to prevent the behavior. 
Moonlight is designed to only import scapy when necessary.
